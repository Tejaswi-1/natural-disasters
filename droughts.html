    <p>Droughts are prolonged periods of abnormally dry weather or water scarcity, leading to a significant shortage of water resources, both on the surface (such as lakes and rivers) and underground (aquifers). Droughts can affect large areas, including regions, states, or even entire countries, and they can last for months or even years. Droughts are a natural part of the climate cycle and can occur in any climate zone, although they are more common in arid and semi-arid regions.
        </p><p>Droughts are caused by various factors, including:

            Lack of precipitation: When an area receives below-average rainfall or snowfall for an extended period, it can lead to a deficiency of water resources.
            
            High temperatures: Elevated temperatures can enhance evaporation rates, leading to the drying out of soil and water bodies.
            
            Climate variability and climate change: Natural climate patterns, such as El Niño and La Niña, can influence rainfall patterns and contribute to drought conditions. Additionally, climate change can exacerbate droughts in some regions by altering weather patterns and intensifying heatwaves.
            
            Deforestation and land degradation: Human activities like deforestation, overgrazing, and improper land management can reduce vegetation cover, which affects the land's ability to retain moisture and exacerbates drought conditions.</p>
