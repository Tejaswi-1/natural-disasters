    <p>An earthquake is a natural geophysical phenomenon characterized by the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, resulting in the shaking and trembling of the ground. It is caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. The Earth's outermost layer is divided into several large and small pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving, albeit very slowly, and they interact with one another along their boundaries.

        When the edges of these plates become stuck or locked together due to friction, stress builds up over time as the plates continue to push against each other. Eventually, the stress reaches a critical point, and the locked section of the plates suddenly slips, releasing the accumulated energy in the form of seismic waves. These seismic waves radiate outwards from the fault line, the area where the plates slipped, and cause the ground to shake.
        </p><p> The point within the Earth where the earthquake originates is called the hypocenter or focus, and the point directly above it on the Earth's surface is known as the epicenter. The severity of an earthquake is measured on the Richter scale or the moment magnitude scale (Mw). This scale assigns a numerical value to quantify the amount of energy released during an earthquake. The higher the magnitude, the more significant the shaking and potential damage to structures and communities.

            Earthquakes can vary in size and impact, ranging from minor tremors that are barely noticeable to catastrophic events capable of causing extensive destruction, loss of life, and triggering other secondary hazards like tsunamis, landslides, and liquefaction.</p>
        <p>Earthquakes are frequent occurrences worldwide, and regions along tectonic plate boundaries, known as seismic zones or fault lines, are particularly prone to experiencing earthquakes. As such, earthquake preparedness, building codes, and early warning systems play crucial roles in reducing the impact of seismic events on communities.</p>
