    <p>A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves, typically caused by underwater disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, or meteorite impacts. The word "tsunami" comes from the Japanese words "tsu" (meaning harbor) and "nami" (meaning wave). It is often referred to as a "seismic sea wave" in scientific literature.

        When an event like an earthquake or volcanic eruption occurs under the ocean, it can displace a massive amount of water, creating a series of powerful waves that travel across the ocean at high speeds, sometimes reaching speeds of up to 500 to 800 kilometers per hour (310 to 500 miles per hour).
        </p><p> While these waves may not be particularly noticeable in deep water, they gain height and destructive force as they approach shallower coastal regions.
        
        When a tsunami reaches the coast, it can result in devastating damage to coastal communities and infrastructure. The waves can flood large areas, sweep away buildings, and cause loss of life and property. Tsunamis can travel across entire ocean basins, and warnings are issued to coastal regions at risk when a potentially hazardous tsunami is detected.</p>
        <p>Early warning systems and improved communication have been implemented in some coastal regions prone to tsunamis to reduce the impact of these natural disasters. Despite these efforts, tsunamis remain a significant natural hazard that demands vigilance and preparedness from communities located in vulnerable areas.</p>
