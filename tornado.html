    <p>A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that forms in contact with both the Earth's surface and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. It is commonly known as a twister, whirlwind, or cyclone. Tornadoes can come in various shapes and sizes, often visible as a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, accompanied by a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it.

        These atmospheric vortices are capable of causing significant damage with their powerful winds. 
        </p><p>Most tornadoes have wind speeds below 180 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour), are about 80 meters (250 feet) across, and travel several kilometers before dissipating. However, the most extreme tornadoes can reach wind speeds exceeding 480 kilometers per hour (300 mph), span more than 3 kilometers (2 miles) in diameter, and stay on the ground for distances greater than 100 kilometers (62 miles) [1].
        
        Tornadoes can take on different forms, including multiple-vortex tornadoes, landspouts, and waterspouts. Waterspouts, in particular, are characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that connects to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They generally form over bodies of water, often in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes [1].</p>
